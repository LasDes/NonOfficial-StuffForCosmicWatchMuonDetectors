# NonOfficial-StuffForCosmicWatchMuonDetectors
Extra code and stuff I have made/adapted for Spencer Axiani's Cosmic Watch Desktop Muon Detector V2
This is a work in progress and there might be the odd bug and issue.

The arduino sketch here is an attempt to get the oled display and the sd card to work at the same time.
